# Supply-Chain-Management-report-power-bi-project-
I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to work on the project of makeup products with **Unified Mentor**. project developed using **Power BI**, I uncovered several critical insights:

1. **High Defect Rate**: Analysis revealed that the defect rate across products is notably high. This emphasizes the need for stricter quality control measures or potential adjustments in production processes.

2. **Top-Selling and Highest Revenue-Generating Product**: The analysis identified the best-performing product in terms of sales volume and the product contributing the most revenue. This provides clarity on which products are driving business growth.

3. **Trends in Sales Performance**: By observing sales trends, I identified key patterns such as seasonality, shifts in consumer preferences, and periods of peak demand. These insights support forecasting and promotional strategies.

4. **Stock Levels vs. Demand**: I visualized which products have high or low stock levels relative to their demand. This helped pinpoint areas where stock adjustments are necessary to avoid overstock or stockouts.

5. **Long Lead Times and Order Optimization**: Products with longer lead times were highlighted, enabling optimization of the ordering processes. By improving planning and supplier relationships, lead times can be reduced, enhancing operational efficiency.

6. **Transportation and Shipping Analysis**: Potential delays and cost-saving opportunities were identified based on transportation routes and shipping carriers. This enables more informed decision-making when selecting carriers and shipping strategies.

7. **Custom Measures**: 
   - Average Lead Time: Created a measure to track and analyze the average lead time across products, improving delivery predictability.
   - Revenue Per Product Sold: This measure provides insights into the profitability of individual products.
   - Shipping Cost Per Product: This helps in identifying how shipping costs contribute to the overall product cost structure.
   - Inventory Turnover: This measure provides a clear view of how efficiently inventory is moving through the supply chain, assisting in optimizing inventory management.

These insights provide actionable data for enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, and driving revenue growth.
